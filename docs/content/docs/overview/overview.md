The Broken Spoke Projects are a collection of software that is used to automate
process around the BNA.

They are written in [Rust], [Python], and [Javascript] with [React]/[Next.js].

The infrastructure relies heavily on [Docker] containers and [Kubernetes].

## Getting started

Depending on your interesting, you may jump directly to the sub-project that
interests you. However it is most likely that you will want to start with the
infrastructure piece.

### Broken Spoke Infrastructure

Several tools using the BNA data:

- Brochure generator
