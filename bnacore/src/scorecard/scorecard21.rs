//! Manage City Rating Scorecards.
//!
//! This module contains the different structures used to compose a ScoreCard as
//! defined in the City Ratings.
//!
//! This module contains Python wrappers, generated by
//! [Py03](https://github.com/PyO3/PyO3). Some of these wrappers are just
//! aliases to other functions, but with a definition that makes them Python
//! compatible. For example, Python does not understand generics, or cannot use
//! slices `&[T]`. Refer to the
//! [Mapping of Rust types to Python types](https://pyo3.rs/v0.16.3/conversions/tables.html)
//! chapter of the Py03 book for more details.
