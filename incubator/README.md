# Incubator

The incubator is a subspace where interesting concepts and ideas can be stored.

The incubated projects are called "bearings". Depending on their maturity they
are organized in 3 categories:

- current: these bearings are being worked on, more or less actively.
- graduated: these bearings proved their worth and got promoted.
- retired: these bearings were cool ideas, but they never bear fruits.

Keep in mind that these projects are experimental and the code is probably not
production ready.
